tutorial_dont_show=Don't show again
tutorial_2_title=Kick Off
tutorial_2_content=We start as the goalkeeper. Our goal is to answer physics questions in order to pass the ball to our teammates and eventually score a goal. Teammates you can pass to have yellow markers above their heads. Please choose a teammate.
tutorial_3_title=Moving and Positioning
tutorial_3_content=After selecting a teammate to pass, you have 5 seconds to move and position your player.
tutorial_4_title=Answering questions and Passing
tutorial_4_content=After getting into position a question will appear. Pressing the 'Y' button will renew the questions(max. 3 times). Pressing the '?' will show the hints screen.
tutorial_5_title=2D Screen
tutorial_5_content=Pressing the '2D/3D' button on the top right corner will toggle the camera mode. We recommend the 2D mode since it looks similar to the questions in textbooks.
tutorial_6_content=You have 3 chances to answer the question. If you give 3 incorrect answers, game will display the correct answer. Note: After the correct answer is shown, giving the right answer doesn't count towards right answers in stats.
tutorial_6_title=Wrong answers
tutorial_7_title=Correct answers
tutorial_7_content=When you give a correct answer, your player will successfully pass the ball.\nTip: The trajectory of the ball is set according to the answer.Ex: If your answer is above the correct answer, the ball will go above and beyond your teammate.\n Are you ready to try? Don't forget the tips!
tutorial_8_title=Forward and goal
tutorial_8_content=Answer questions successfully and you will reach the forward player. Select one of the targets on corners of the keep and get ready to score!
